# ResistorTrainer
Is a Python written tool designed to help you train your resistor value reading skills.
How does it work ?
WHen launchiing the program, you are prompted with a tkinter interface, on the interface, you can see a beautiful resistor with different color strips, just read the value, type it into the text-box and submit your answer! If it's right, good, you can go to the next one and continue your training. If it isn't... don't worry! You still have 3 more tries.
