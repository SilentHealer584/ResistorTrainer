# ResistorTrainer
is a Python written tool designed to help you train your resistor value reading skills.
How does it train me ?
When launchiing the program, a tkinter interface pops up, on the interface, you can see a beautiful resistor with different color strips, just read the value, type it into the text-box and submit your answer! If it's right, good, you can jump to the next resistor and continue your training. If it isn't... don't worry! You still have 3 more tries.
